The reduced.py file is a script that produces 2000 smoke images (different among them for source size and position).
The 'result_2000_images_400_epochs_8_batchsize' contains reconstructions and gt of images from the 2000 smoke images dataset.
The main.py can be run to reproduce the said results (almost, I have not fixed any random seed, so the reconstructed images will be different).
